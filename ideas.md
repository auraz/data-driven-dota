Possible Ideas
==============

1. Visualization of popular heroes/win rates on different servers

1. Something to do with the Dota map itself
(movement patterns, locations of kills, etc)

1. Comparisons of heroes and hero stats, like the [Chinese Dota 2 Website](http://db.dota2.com.cn/compares)

1. MMR Data; Is there a way to get this? Maybe not?
2. 

Look at this totally awesome map I found [click here](http://dotamap.critwhale.com/) that we can build a better version of (maybe when you click on something more info can pop up, etc.)
