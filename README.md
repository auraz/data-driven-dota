Data-Driven-Dota: A Dota 2 Statistical Exploration
=====================

### Angela Fan, Robbie Gibson, Benjy Levin

* Code:
	
	All the code in the css, html, and js folders was mainly written by us.
There are some code snippets taken from other places, but those are all cited in comments.
We, of course, used the d3 library, as well as jQuery, Bootstrap, and intro.js.
We also wrote our own d2 "library" which contained many functions that we wrote for loading and accessing our data.
